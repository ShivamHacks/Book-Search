## Inspiration
My grandfather spent a week creating a spreadsheet of all of the books in our home, so I created an interface to interact with the data he created.

## Tech Stack
Back-end: Python Flask  
Database: None as of now, used static CSV file  
Front-end: Angular.js, Bootstrap, JQuery  

## Future Improvements
Functionality
1. Search exclusively by Title or Author, etc. (currently searches for matches in all fields)
2. Advanced Search - use similar terms (search for cat, return kitten books) and relationships (search for history, return biographies)
3. User profiles to save reading lists, personalize table, etc.
4. Make books editable
5. Ability to download the page after making changes
6. Search for similar books / books on the same topics
Interface
2. Highlight search matches in results
